# National-Parks
SwiftUI app made for my Mobile Applications course at Georgia Tech, [in conjunction with Mr. Koohang's National Park Service API using Heroku/Flask](https://github.com/mkoohang/national-parks-api)

You can run the app yourself by cloning this repo and running the app with Xcode 11 or later. 

Huge thanks to Paul Hudson from [Hacking With Swift](HackingWithSwift.com) - for just about any SwiftUI question I could think of, he already had an article written about it. Except a SwiftUI build issue with the very obvious fix of deleting my Derived Data. Which admittedly took up about half of the development time of this app. Something to consider before using SwiftUI on your production quality app.
